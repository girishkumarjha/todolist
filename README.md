# To Do List Project


## Goals
* Create a new project using Bootstrap and jQuery
* Learn how HTML, CSS and jQuery work with one another


## Provided files
We have included a blank HTML, CSS and JS file for you to get started with a basic project structure.

## Getting Started

In your index.html file include Bootstrap's CSS and add a <code>script</code> tag to include your <code>todo.js</code> file.

Review the items we covered in the lecture. There are a few ways to do this project but some of the methods you might think about using include:

* <code>.appendTo()</code>
* <code>.remove()</code>
* <code>.parent()</code>
* <code>.toggleClass()</code>

## Features

Your To Do List app can look and function however you'd like. However, we'd like to see the below features supported. You can view our example version at [http://rcacademy.github.io/todolist](http://rcacademy.github.io/todolist).

#### Day 1
* A user should be able to add a task to a list
* A user should be able to view a list of their items
* A user should be able to mark a task as complete
* A user should be able to delete a task

#### Day 2
* A user should be able to hit the "enter" key to add an item
* A user should be able to delete all their items at once
* A user should be able to edit their items
* Bonus: A user should be able to still see their items if they refresh the page (localStorage)

## Looking Forward
* How might we let a user reorder their tasks?
* How could we support organizing tasks into categories?
* How about assigning tasks to someone else?


## Potential Solutions
You can check these out if you want to see examples and potential solutions. Please try to do these yourself before you see how we have built them.
